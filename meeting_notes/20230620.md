### Notes
* Assign-value (NCP = 1) try using UNCONDiTIONAL_DELETE see https://github.com/NCAR/lrose-HawkEdit/issues/67
* Wen-Chau: the spirit of the cfac file is to accumulate the cfacs in a cumulative external file.
* Make sure one can open a file if georefs have not been applied. Test this and make sure this is allowed.
* Wen-Chau: AOS (APAR simulated data) CRSIM can generate some example APAR data. Test this on HawkEdit 
* There are four different panels with APAR.  The navigation correction equations may need to be modified (+5 and -30 degrees in addition to fore and aft; there is also the top panel that has no reference point).each panel may need its own georef block. For side panels there are reference points, but not the top panel.

### Action items
* Open data file without georefs applied
