Notes
* We work on functionality; then pass to CISL for speed up?
* Priority: spreadsheet editor, followed by boundary editor.
* Clicking between fields, the associated field colorbar does NOT update immediately. After color bars have been edited. When hit Apply, take the text that is in the edit box and NOT require a mouse click away or ENTER. See if there is a setting in the text edit box to take action regardless of mouse click away or enter.
* Medium QC script needs to be converted syntax; work through BAD_FLAGS functions. (priority after cfac’s issue). Brenda translate the script first.
* Intervening individual script edits are NOT retained after a batch save.


Action items
* Brenda: figure out optimization compile flag that may speed up the processing (-O3 doesn't work).
* (1) Brenda is working on the spreadsheet editor bug.
* (2) Boundary is not respected with airborne data (cfac are present).
* Cfacs for consistency. Will come back to this; may need a toggle in HawkEdit to apply and remove.
* Should there be one save regardless of mode?  “Save everything in the state that it is.” Let’s leave it alone for now. And get feedback once HawkEdit is in the would for a wile.
* Boundary display points need to scale with the data; for NEXRAD data, the points are really small.
* Script intermediate variables are persisted in the file and parameter dialog and should be removed.
* Batch save may neglect other sweeps, i.e. not save all sweeps to saved file.
