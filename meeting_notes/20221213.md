Attendees: Brenda, Brad, Alex 

Notes:
* Overwrite  all files in batch mode is working and helps. 
* unfold/fold in spreadsheet editor worked

Action items (#priority):
* Find an action to detect edits in the parameter color dialog without requiring an enter
* Cap the undo/redo stack to 3 or 4?
* Ray sort is still in progress is unnecessary warning.
* (#2) Make apply correction factors as a default.
* (#3) Load one file, load separate file, with different fields variables, the field list is messed up in the display.  The update squishes the new fields all to the bottom of the list. 
* delay the fix of the y-axis colinear with a boundary edge error.
* (#1) spreadsheet editor; 10 rays; airborne data; HawkEdit crashes, even after apply correction factors. Refresh crashes the spreadsheet editor with airborne data; ok with ground-based radar.
* (#4) Script editor auto fill syntax needs to be updated.
* run profiler on HawkEdit script edits to find what is taking the most time.
* Need to add RHI window and features.
