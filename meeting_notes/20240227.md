## No meeting today, just a few updates

#### Georeference calculations and display
* rerunning the data files through RadxConvert and then retest with HawkEdit in progress.
  
#### Testing of linux installer: 
* tested on one EOL linux machine; RadxPrint works.
* tested on EOL linux machine, displaying on Mac M1: RadxPrint works, HawkEdit works, but the GUI windows are a bit warped.
* best to stick with linux display when using linux installer for LROSE.

#### Multipanel display with HawkEdit
* some prototype QtQuick/Qml examples are looking promising.  An image provider class is working with a tile grid display.
* tiles can be added and deleted and rearranged within the grid.

1. update on georeference calculations and display (RadxConvert/HawkEdit)
2. test results with linux installer (for RadxPrint and maybe HawkEdit)
3. update on multipanel display for HawkEdit
4. other topics
