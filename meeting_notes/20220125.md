Meeting Notes (Alex, Brenda)

## Undo/Redo (batch mode vs. individual scan mode)
Alex described a typical editing session as:
1. Run a script on a set of archive files (batch mode)
2. Edit individual files using scripts and spreadsheet editor
  * Select individual file (from Time Navigation)
  * edit, undo, redo


### Proposed design of Undo/Redo 

#### Undo/Redo stack as temp directory
keep undo/redo stack in temp directory, one directory for each archive file in set
```
basedir/.tmp/file_1/v1
            /file_2
            /file_100/v1
                     /v2
```
#### Move Undo/Redo stack from Time Nav Controller, to its own MVC classes
Maybe rename to FileVersionMVC?

Keep list (vector) of currentVersion of each file in Time Nav set.
``` vector <int> currentVersion ```. This is one stack for each archive file in Time Nav.
Moving up and down the stack (undo/redo) is moving up and down in version number in the 
```basedir/.tmp/file_1``` dir. 

##### clear
remove .tmp dir // removes all temp versions; clears the stacks
##### undo(int file#)
##### redo(int file#)
##### writeToVersion(currentFile, tempFile_N)
set currentVersion for the file.
##### getNextVersion(int file#) or (path/file) 
```.tmp/file_1/vN```
##### save(int file#)
``` fn = getCurrentVersion(file#) ```
```    move (fn, savePath) ```
##### saveAll(bool overwrite, path)
saves current version of all files
