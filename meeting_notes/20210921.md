Meeting Notes (Alex, Brad, Brenda)

We talked about three main issues:
* REMOVE_RING
  - Need to update the autofill syntax offered by the Script Editor.  The syntax in HawkEdit follows a function with arguments, instead of the sentence like syntax of SoloII.
  - The fill value should be the missing value, not zero.
  - The upper and lower bounds of the ring specified in the arguments are not correctly used.  Maybe a scale factor or unit conversion.
  - Note:  REMOVE_RING is a "fill-value" function, link unconditional delete.  A good rule of thumb is "If data has a valid zero value, then use the missing value for a fill value."
* AOS data does not display in HawkEdit or HawkEye either.  The data are APAR simulated data. In HawkEye, the vertical scan, RHI window pops up, but no data appear.  Brad will send a sample data file to Brenda and Mike for further investigation.  
* Spreadsheet Fold
  - fold by ```2 * Nyquist Velocity ```
  - ``` +/- Fold Ray > ``` unfold from ALL selected gates, for all rays selected to end of ray.  Currently, the folding only happens for one ray. Make this an issue.  

High Priority is:
1.  assignment (reuse field names) (Brenda is working here)
2.  UNCONDITIONAL_DELETE in script
3.  correct REMOVE_RING + auto-complete

All of these are needed for the Touch-Up Editing Use Case.
