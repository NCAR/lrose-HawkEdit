Meeting Notes

### Current Work Plan

* get unit tests working again.
* select (azimuth, rotation, etc.) to use as “azimuth” in plot. **
* test boundary with remove_aircraft_motion plotted with rotation angle
* look into Brad’s AOS variable name error/issue
* what other Solo functions use radar_angles?


** There is an issue with detecting the Y-Prime axis.  Both Dorade and CfRadial files have Y-Prime axis, and this can indicate the use of rotation for azimuth in plotting the data. But, for Dorade, the azimuth is already replaced with the rotation.
Probably HawkEdit should have an option to select the coordinate to plot for the radial component (the one that we have always been using as azimuth).
