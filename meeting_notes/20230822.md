## HawkEdit Users Group

Attendees: Brenda, Jen, Alex  

### Notes
* Cai et. al.: can build Fortran version on Mac, with the path to the system library to fix -LSystem error. See Makefile in lrose-core/codebase/apps/radar/src/CreateCfacs/Makefile_save.
* Table the calcRatio HawkEdit function until after the radar conference.
* Results from Alex testing:
 1. TODO: Copy field, have new field inherit properties of original field.
 2. Would be nice to have parameter file editing; to set color scale params interactively, and then save these setting to a parameter file.
 3. Airborne data manual unfold/fold in spreadsheet does not work; probably need to send the airborne variables. Ground-based data works, though.
 4. Click-centering in the spreadsheet works!!


### Action items
* Alex: will test compiling  the Fortran version of the Cai et. al. code.
* Brenda: implement RAIN_RATE and other functions needed for Conrad and Paul.
