Meeting Notes (Brad, Brenda)

We talked about test results using the latest release:  Some individual tests and also trying the airborne radar QC test case 
(remove-only-surface and correction factors)
and the ground-based QC test case (unfolding).

We talked about using RadxMergeFields as a post-processing step to merge edited fields with unedited fields.  
Currently, when HawkEdit saves files, only the fields selected when the file is opened are written to output files.
Any fields that are created in scripts are also written to output files.  One solution is to use RadxMergeFields
to join the edited fields with the original fields.  Brad noted that is it difficult to 
anticipate which fields will need to be edited (a priori) when a file is opened.  Brenda suggested some form
of a "lazy read" on the data fields, in order to handle large amounts of data.  A lazy read would mean, read and plot
a field when requested.  

## Results from testing

### Brad's testing
Test case 1: File->Open, pan (double click to move the center), Unzoom to return to the original center point.  
Currently, there is no way to return to the centered display without a zoom/unzoom.  Brad suggest the Unzoom
to recenter the display in the absence of zoom.  This helps to keep the menu options simple, and yet provide
an intuitive way to recenter the display.

Test case 2: Undo/Redo. This seems to work

Test case 3: Remove_ring on one file, for one sweep.  HawkEdit crashed.  Brad will share the PECAN, SPOL data file
to help reproduce the problem.

Test case 4: HawkEdit crashes when navigating among large data sets.  A large data set has multiple sweeps, multiple
fields, and multiple files.

### Alex's testing
** coming soon **

### Airborne Radar QC test case
#### Question:  How are the cfrad* data files produced?  Using Soloii?
The cfrad* data files have the correction factors applied 
```RadxPrint -rays -f cfrad* | grep georefs_applied ```
shows the georeferences have been applied.  The values in the georeferences block for a ray do not correspond to the
cfac.fore or cfac.aft data files in the test case.  Could the cfrad* data files be produced using the original, 
uncorrected swp.* file, using ```RadxConvert -apply_georefs -read_cfac... -f swp*```?  The swp.* files have zeroes 
in the CFAC block.
