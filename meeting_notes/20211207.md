Meeting notes (Alex, Brad, Brenda)

* Time Slider/Controller - continuing work
* Alex posted a data set for navigation correction
* Prompt for directory to store temporary files when running script over multiple times (files).


Navigation correction data set is in [Github data repo](https://github.com/Alex-DesRosiers/radarqc_scans) under radar QC directory.
This is the next use case to test. We talked about three possible ways to specify the correction factors file in HawkEdit:
1.  Import CFAC file as using a new button on the Script Editor Dialog (as GUI)
2.  Brad suggested a script command (as f(x))
3.  REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION(<cfac-file>, ... ).  (as arg)
  
Note: remove aircraft motion command operates on a velocity field.

Need to merge cfac's into data file in CfRadial format.  Originally, the cfacs block is empty (i.e. all values are zero).
  
Question: are the correction factors (cfacs) only in DORADE format? or are they in CfRadial format also? 

Question: are the variables in the CfRadial cfacs block the variables that the Soloii function expects?
Brad said there are some cfac blocks in CfRadial files for PECAN data.  For example, the Soloii se_remove_ac_motion
needs an ew_velocity variable.  Does this correspond to the ew_ground_speed_correction variable CFAC file?
  
Question: maybe a separate RadxConvert step to merge cfacs into every CfRadial data file?
