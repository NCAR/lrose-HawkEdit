Meeting Notes (Alex, Brenda)

Alex did some initial testing of the latest release that has the on-demand sweep loading.  Alex noticed that the data load faster
for large sets like NEXRAD data.  Some of the issues that Alex noticed with this latest version are:
* Parameter Dialog changes are not updating the colorscale and other items in the polar display.
* One must click in the polar display to update the metadata in the leftside panel.
* An error message "ray sorting still in progress, try electing again", is reported, but when OK is clicked, the polar display seems fine. This may be related to other odd behavior we are seeing.  Brenda will investigate further.
* In consistent order of scan angles is displayed in the righthand panel of sweep numbers.  This may be caused by QC of the data.  Alex will check into this more and report back.


There was some discussion and explanation of the Nyquist velocity missing value issue reported here.
