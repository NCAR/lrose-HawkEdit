Meeting Notes (Alex, Brad, Brenda)

Brenda presented the latest release of HawkEdit with on demand sweep loading. This should provide faster loading and displaying large data files,
such as those from NEXRAD.  Spreadsheet editing should be working.  The script engine is not working and needs an update to use the on demand sweep 
loading.  The left side panel of the polar display is working and displays details of the sweep and meta data. 
Clicking in the polar display updates the left side panel as well as the spreadsheet editor if it is open.
The right side of the polar display uses the sweep number to reference scan angles instead of the floating
point value of the angle.  The scan angle for the selected sweep number can be found in the left panel of details and meta data.

Alex asked how we could announce, or advertise HawkEdit once we have a stable version.  
Brad suggested tracking HawkEdit using a DOI, which allows publications to reference a particular version
of HawkEdit.  In some ways, as Brad mentioned, HawkEdit may be similar to tracking published data sets.
Workshops on open software provide an opportunity to demostrate and advertise HawkEdit for interactive
data editing. 
We will continue to think about the different approaches available and discuss the ideas at the next meeting
in two weeks.
