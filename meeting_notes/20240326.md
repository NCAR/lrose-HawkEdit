# No meeting today
Since there are just a few updates and lots of work to be done, the meeting was cancelled.

### Updates

* Brenda is working on multipanel display in HawkEdit and a Linux installer of LROSE.
* Josh is finding time to test the linux installer.
* Jen found and reported a bug in HawkEdit where HawkEdit only saves 1 sweep out of a ground-based full volume scan.
* Alex suggested we add a routine test to prevent the bug Jen reported from reappearing in future releases.
  (add some steps to the testing procedures document that target the bug Jen found so we make sure it does not return in future releases once it's patched.)
