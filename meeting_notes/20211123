Meeting Notes (Brad, Brenda)

BB_UNFOLDING is probably working now.  The syntax of the command needed updating.  
We need a new release (DMG) and more testing.  The next release will be next week, most likely after
the addition of the time slider.

We talked about the Time Slider as navigation only through the time dimension of the data set.
The Script Editor dialog gets two new text edit lines for start and end time, along with calendar and time widgets.
Brad said year, month, day, hour, and minutes are enough precision for the start and end times for the script to apply.
We talked about the Time Slider and the Script Editor dialog; the two really don't interact with each other.  

We talked about the multiple window display feature that is on the horizon.  It seems the RHI display and the multiple
window display features are related and may be implemented at the same time.  
We talked about a possible use case with a four-panel PPI display showing four different data fields.  
Now, suppose a data file containing an RHI scan is opened.  Then, a separate RHI window would popup with
a four-panel RHI display, showing the same four data fields.  Anyway, we just started talking about how
the multipanel displays might work for both PPI and RHI data.

The multiple window display feature may be implemented using Qt dynamic layouts.  Dynamic layouts are new 
to HawkEdit and HawkEye and will require further investigation and learning.

That's about it.  Happy Thanksgiving!
