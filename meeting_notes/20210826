August 26, 2021 meeting notes:
Alex and Brenda

Demo of new release of HawkEdit that replots changes made to the Spreadsheet editor (known as Examine in Soloii).
See notes on the release page for version 20210826.  Also try File->Save to export the data edits made.

Question about spreadsheet edits respecting a boundary.  The answer is no.  To perform data changes with respect
to a boundary, use the Scripts.  From the Script editor, click use boundary and then perform an unconditional delete
of the data.

The next features and bug fixes will follow the list of items from the meeting of 20210805 with the addition of these:
* get click-centering working.  A click in the polar display should immediately center the Spreadsheet on the sweep, ray, and gate of the click.
  This should happen without a Refresh in the spreadsheet navigator. If however, there are unfinished edits, then a warning message
  appears indicating "There are unfinished edits, please apply the edits or clear the edits."
* double-click in polar display to translate the image, while keeping the zoom level constant. 
  In Soloii, double-clicking in a corner, or edge moves the center of the display to the click point, without changing
  the zoom level. This movement/translation would NOT be connected to drawing a boundary as is the case in Soloii.
* bug fix, get the boundary editor working again.
* set the text size and boundary point size fixed, so that zooming in does not create giant text, or giant boundary point markers.
* get Clear Edits working.

There will be no meeting next week.  We will meet again after the Labor Day weekend.
