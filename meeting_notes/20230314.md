Meeting Notes March 14, 2023
Attendees: Jen, Brad, Alex, Brenda

We talked about the results of applying georeferences/navigation corrections to the DORADE Aft data that Alex posted. Two different paths: SoloII (radar_angles)
and RadxRay (applyGeoreferences).  The images look the same once the rotation angle is used instead of the azimuth (i.e. azimuth = rotation). 
Please see the [navigations corrections notes](https://github.com/NCAR/lrose-HawkEdit/blob/main/navigation_correction_notes.md) for further details.

There are still some outstanding questions and Jen and Brenda will meet with Mike to hopefully resolve the questions.

Brenda continues to document the script functions that will appear in the Help section of HawkEdit script window.
