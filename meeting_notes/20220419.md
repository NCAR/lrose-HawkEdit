Meeting Notes (Alex, Brenda)

We talked about the latest release and tests for batch edit, undo/redo, and save.  

* separate the edit mode from the Edit menu; create a new main window menu Mode, with options for Batch mode vs. Individual scan mode
* there is an error message during batch edit if the scan angle varies by more than 0.01 degress from the scan angle of the file currently selected when edit script is run.


* start testing with a NEXRAD data set to simultaneously speed up the access to large data files.

#### Bugs in the latest release
* batch save: not writing edits to files NOT currently selected (this bug is fixed)
* currently selected file has edits saved, but NOT merged fields (not all fields are in saved version).
* overwrite file message needs other options (overwrite, keep both, discard changes).
* new fields are NOT appearing in list in parameter-color dialog.
* batch edit with all scan angles causes a vector error message box, then the program exits with a segmentation fault.
* there are still chunks of scan NOT displayed.  Alex will try to isolate some data files where this occurs.


New release coming soon with fixes.
