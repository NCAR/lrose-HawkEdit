Ammar demonstrated deglitch using Python in Google Colab.  Deglitch seems to be working correctly.  Ammar tested the function on real data and synthetic data generated using sin and cos function.  

We had a discussion about 1D and 2D deglitch functions.  Currently, Soloii and HawkEdit, and Python Solo interface perform 1D deglitch of the data.  Wen-Chau challenged us to think about how to implement 2D and even 3D deglitching.   Wen-Chau also explained how the background in not constant.  Rather, it is more of a gradient.  We talked about how this variability in the background could be handled when detecting discontinuities in the data.  Deglitch, and despeckle are basically detecting discontinuities in the data.  

Alex is continuing to gather and post relavant data sets to the Github repository of benchmark data. 

Brad is continuing to test HawkEdit and has noted errors when opening additional data files.  Brad also noticed an error when HawkEdit tries to display DBZ field.  Wen-Chau noticed a similar error, when the data field is dBZ.  For some reason, HawkEdit wonâ€™t correctly graph the DBZ fields, but HawkEye can.  Brad and Wen-Chau also noticed an error when changing the color scale of a field.  The data are not redrawn with the new color scale.  All of these errors have been reported in the lrose-HawkEdit repo. 

Brenda is continuing to integrate the missing Boundary Editor features.  There is some restructuring of the code that is needed for the integration.
