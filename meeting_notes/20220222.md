Meeting Notes (Brad, Alex, Brenda)

### Batch Mode vs. Individual Edit Mode
1. Move Batch mode to main menu; remove from Script Editor
2. Indicate mode in the Window Title (HawkEdit - Batch Mode) or (HawkEdit - Individual Scan Mode)
3. There are two possible modes for edits and the Redo/Undo/Save operations ARE context dependent.  
4. Prompt to save changes upon exit from either mode.
5. 


#### Context Dependent actions of these operations:
##### A Save in Batch Mode, will save the current version of ALL files in the data set.  Save in Individual Scan Mode saves the current version of the active file.
##### Redo/Undo in Batch Mode, moves ALL the files in the data set up/back a version.  Redo/Undo in Individual Scan Mode only changes the current file.

### Process log
coming soon

### CFAC file
We need a separate session to discuss the results of the REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION and REMOVE_ONLY_SURFACE functions.  It looks like RadxConvert will
handle the correction factors as a preprocessing step.
