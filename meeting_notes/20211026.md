Meeting Notes (Alex, Brad, Brenda)

Brad talked about the color scales in the Parameter Color Dialog.  To change color scales, just click on the current
scale and a list of available color scales will pop up.  The name of the color scale appears if one hovers over the
color scale image.  The name may also contain the path to the color scale if the scale is imported from an existing directory.  
Brad suggested having the most common color scales preloaded.  Yes, this is possible and will be added.  

Alex noted that click-center in the spreadsheet editor does NOT work when the polar display is zoomed. (Fixed).

Alex added issued to track a couple issues:
* unconditional delete should only work on one sweep, not all the sweeps in the volume.  We can add a check box to the script editor dialog that selects all sweeps, or current sweep.
* Clear Edits is not working in spreadsheet editor.


TODO List:
1. Preload HawkEye default color scales. 
2. Polar display is zoomed, isOverBoundary is NOT working. Fixed.
3. Add checkbox to script editor to select current sweep, or all sweeps. Needed for workshop demo.
4. Clear Edits is not working. Needed for workshop demo.
