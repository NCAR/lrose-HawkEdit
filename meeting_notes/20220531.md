Meeting Notes (Alex, Brenda)

Alex reported on further tests:
* In batch mode, merge save error: only saves edits for the first file and no merge of fields.  The other files are unchanged.
* Missing rays in the polar display is still a problem.
* In individual mode, merge save is not working either.

Brenda is working to speed up the code with sample NEXRAD data files.  The NEXRAD test files have 15 sweeps, and 7 data fields. Reading the sweeps on demand instead of reading and plotting all sweeeps and all fields when a new file is opened, should be faster.
