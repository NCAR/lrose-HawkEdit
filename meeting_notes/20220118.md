Meeting Notes (Brenda, Alex)

## Remove Aircraft Motion
The REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION script function uses one value from the correction factors (cfac) block and that is ew_gndspd_corr.  The REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION function adjusts the velocity by an adjustment, ac_vel.
```
    vert =  vert_velocity != -999 ? vert_velocity : 0;
    d = sqrt((double)(SQ(ew_velocity) + SQ(ns_velocity)));
    d += ew_gndspd_corr; // klooge to correct ground speed
    ac_vel = d*sin(tilt) + vert*sin(elevation);
```

## Navigation Correction
Navigation correction uses the cfac values.  RadxConvert also performs a similar (if not the same) correction with the flag apply_georeference_corrections.  From the RadxConvert documentation:
```Option to apply the georeference information and corrections for moving platforms.

    For moving platforms, measured georeference information (e.g. from a GPS/NS) is sometimes available in the file. 
    
    If goereference data ia available, there is an optional corrections block that may also be stored in the file. 
    
    If this parameter is true, the georeference data is applied and appropriate corrections made if corrections are available. 
    
    If possible, Earth-centric azimuth and elevation angles will be computed.
```


## Batch Mode Editing

Define Batch Mode (on/off)
* Where should batch mode on/off button be? In the script editor? Yes.

* Undo/Redo applies to group of files defined in the Time Navigation.   

ON : 
Entry to batch mode (Time Navigation defines the time range of the files)
1.   toggle batch mode on/off button
2.   edit in spreadsheet editor

Exit
1. toggle batch mode on/off button  ==> Save
2. open new file ==> Save

OFF : 
Entry to individual file edits (select file using Time Navigation or open a file)
1. something ...

Exit
1. toggle batch mode on/off button 
2. Undo/Redo ==> Save
3. select different file ==> Save
4. open new file ==> Save

## REMOVE_ONLY_SURFACE
TODO: convert this function.

## FORCED_UNFOLDING
Is this converted? covered by spreadsheet unfolding?
