Attendees: Jen, Brad, Alex, Brenda


* Located the cause of the display issues (beam block on airborne data) and should be fixed in latest release.  
* There are a couple of issues for discussion tomorrow regarding the application of the correction factors:
1. What to display in the spreadsheet editor?  The data with the correction factors applied? or the uncorrected data?
2. What to save?  the corrected data? YES or the uncorrected data?  NO. And make a note in the meta data in the data file.  And write a cfac.fore and cfac.aft. Correction factors have been applied. 
3. Do we want to make a select option to apply the correction factors? 
4. What is the order of REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION and applying correction factors?
 
 


Notes
* Need to figure out help script syntax and make it useful.
* Alex’s test results are in Notes in HawkEdit google drive 
* Brad asked about how Ting-Yu’s files were saved.  Maybe some way the files were saved?  Brenda needs to look into these more. Cfradial -> dorade -> cfradial may be an issue??
* Boundary issues when there are correction factors.


GUI for selecting a cfac file and then apply it to all files in a directory.
