# HawkEdit Users Group

Attendees: Brenda, Jennifer, Wen-chau, Isaac

## Notes
* Welcome to new team member Isaac. 
* Find some decision points to present to the group.  Recommend everyone to participate in the meeting to discuss some major syntax rule, or convention.   Organize meetings around these topics and send email before meeting to let everyone know there is a decision to be made.
* Wen-Chau: think about how to debug a 15-line script?
* Wen-Chau: make the parameters into keywords.  This will help with debugging and provide one way to do things which should help with keeping things simple and prevent “stepping on our own toes” when writing scripts.

## Action items
* Add context-sensitive help to the list of tasks to implement
* At next meeting, consider the user guide done; move on to next step of getting feedback/comments; Isaac will read the guide and provide comments once the guide is ready for internal review.
* Jen: Add video to explain unfolding.  Try to find an unfolding video from Alex. Use vimeo? Or youtube to access videos.
* Brenda: send out an agenda before each meeting. Include items for discussion, items for decisions, vs.  just general updates.  Then everyone knows if they need to attend or if they can skip the meeting. 
* Brenda: think about how to make parameters keywords in the script editor.  Is this possible to enforce?
