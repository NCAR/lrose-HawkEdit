### Status Updates
#### Brenda
testing with Conrad's data from 20190609 and this script


  


Issues related to correction factors (cfacs):
* Data sent to SoloII f(x) need:
    1. georefs applied
    2. cfacs NOT applied
    3. send individual cfacs as args to f(x) that need them.
* The current data file, after running a script needs the cfacs applied for proper display.


Q: Is there a disconnect between data in the spreadsheet and the display? in terms of cfactors, since the cfactors change the az and el?


Q: Does the boundary work when scripts are run on data without cfactors applied?


Q: Are cfactors applied BEFORE or AFTER georef calculations?
