Meeting Notes (Jen, Alex, Brad, Brenda)

### Status Updates
#### Brenda
testing with Conrad's data from 20190609 and this script ...
```
OPTIMAL_BEAMWIDTH = 3.0
D0 = REMOVE_ONLY_SURFACE( DBZ, OPTIMAL_BEAMWIDTH, 0 )
VGR = REMOVE_ONLY_SURFACE( VEL, OPTIMAL_BEAMWIDTH, 0 )
V0 = REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION( VGR)
```

Issues related to correction factors (cfacs):
* Data sent to SoloII f(x) need:
    1. georefs applied
    2. cfacs NOT applied
    3. send individual cfacs as args to f(x) that need them.
* The current data file, after running a script needs the cfacs applied for proper display.


Q: Is there a disconnect between data in the spreadsheet and the display? in terms of cfactors, since the cfactors change the az and el?


Q: Does the boundary work when scripts are run on data without cfactors applied?


Q: Are cfactors applied BEFORE or AFTER georef calculations?


Prioritize work: 

1. Fix navigation correction reset error message
2. Function validation prototype code (Brenda send results to Alex for validation with SoloII)
3. Repair functions which require navigation corrections (ex: REMOVE_ONLY_SURFACE, REMOVE_AIRCRAFT_MOTION)
4. Intermediate User Guide (auto-complete and in app help improvements as well)
5. RHI display addition
6. Multi-window display
7. Implement more custom display functions (e.g. color palette step)
8. Save color scale configs as parameter files
9. Cap the undo/redo stack

Action Items:
* (Brenda) do a brew install lrose-core on test Mac; does ~/lrose/bin/HawkEdit work on the command-line on MacOS?
* (Brenda) send input and output data files, and script to Alex for SoloII validation.
