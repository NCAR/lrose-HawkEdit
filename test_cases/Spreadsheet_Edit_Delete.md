Test case: Spreadsheet Editor - Delete (set to missing)

On Solo II. The 'Delete Field' function would actually be something new that did not previously exist in the spreadsheet editor equivalent of Solo II. The original command was 'Delete' which would be used on one radar gate at a time since you were unable to select multiple gates at once. If delete was selected and the user clicked on a radar gate, it would be set to missing value. The same goes for 'Delete Ray' but the entire ray would be set to missing values. 

On HawkEdit.
Spreadsheet Editor - Delete will set the selected gates to the missing value specified in the Configuration Dock.

Spreadsheet Editor - Delete Ray will set the selected ray (column) to missing values.
